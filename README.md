Bank Loan Report Summary Analysis with Power BI
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and presenting key financial metrics related to loans using Power BI. The interactive dashboard provides an intuitive view of loan data, allowing stakeholders to easily understand the performance of loans. It includes a summary of good loans, bad loans, MoM (Month-over-Month) performance, MTD (Month-to-Date) figures, and other financial metrics, such as interest rates.

The goal of this project is to simplify the presentation of complex loan data, making it accessible and easy to understand for decision-makers and financial analysts.

Project Summary
Data Source: The data used in this project includes various loan-related metrics such as loan types, loan statuses, interest rates, customer demographics, and monthly repayment performance.
Objective: To build an interactive dashboard using Power BI that visually represents:
Good vs. Bad Loans (based on repayment behavior)
MoM loan performance trends
MTD metrics to track loan issuance and repayments for the current month
Interest rate analysis
Other key financial indicators
Features
The dashboard offers the following features:

Good Loans vs. Bad Loans: Visual comparison to easily identify the percentage of loans that are performing well versus those that are delinquent or at risk.
Month-over-Month (MoM) Performance: Shows how loan issuance, repayments, and defaults change on a month-to-month basis.
Month-to-Date (MTD) Metrics: Real-time figures tracking the progress of loans in the current month.
Interest Rate Analysis: Breaks down loans based on the interest rate categories, helping in understanding which rates are more prone to defaults or successes.
Loan Summary: A comprehensive breakdown of loan amounts, customers, and categories.
Key Insights
Loan Health: Insights into the overall health of the loan portfolio by identifying the proportion of non-performing loans (bad loans) versus performing loans (good loans).
Trend Analysis: The MoM visualizations help track trends in loan performance, defaults, and repayments.
Risk Management: By analyzing bad loans, the dashboard assists in identifying risk factors such as high-interest rates or specific customer segments.
Customer Segmentation: Breakdown of loans based on customer demographics like age, income, and credit score to target areas for improvement.
Power BI Capabilities
Interactive Visualizations: Drill-down capabilities enable users to explore specific data points such as loan types, customer segments, and timelines.
Filters and Slicers: Filters can be applied to view loan performance based on time periods, loan types, or interest rate categories.
Real-Time Data: The dashboard can be connected to live databases for real-time updates of loan information.
